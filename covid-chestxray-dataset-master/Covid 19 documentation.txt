										----------------------------

Hi mam,

Sorry for the delay mam,

I have preprocessed and built the models within 2 days mam , but the problem is that the accuracy and f1 score was low, so that only I was unable to submit to you mam

Now after I did some changes now its working properly with best accuracy and f1-score of 100 % mam.

Mam I worked on Xray images and I asked Shriram to do the CT scan image dataset mam

Dataset Information:
---------------------

1.I took the Covid(pos) from the dataset that you had sent mam ,for Covid(neg) I saw the research paper and took those normal sample pics from kaggle chest xray pneumonia samples, I took 50 Covid and 50 Normal patient pics and then split it into  80:20 ratio mam.
Dataset Information:https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
In this first project I used VGG19,VGG16,ResNet50,DenseNet201,Xception,InceptionResNetV2.


2.I took the dataset that you had sent mam did it with VGG19 classifier for categorizing Covid-19 among various diseases with respect to lung xray images


3.I took kaggle dataset of Covid_19_classifier in which images of Covid-19,normal,pneumonia images were given and I used InceptionV3 classifier for that
Dataset Information:https://www.kaggle.com/rgaltro/newdataset

------------------------------------------------------------------
Summmary of Covid 19 classification:
-----------------------------------

For projects 1 and 2 
learning_rate=1e-5,batch_size=2,epochs=30

input size of image=(224,224,3)
-----------------------------------------------------
The pretrained models are trained with weights of 'imagenet'
---------------------------------------------------------
For project 1:

0-Covid-19,1-Normal

1.DenseNet201(high)
2.VGG19(high)
3.VGG16(high)

all score 100% accuracy with specificity and sensitivity to be 100%

recall,f1-score nd precision also scores 100%

4.ResNet50 -accuracy of 86%

5.Xception - accuracy of 91.7%

6.InceptionResNet - accuracy of 68.3%(low)

Here for these models F1-scores,sensitivity and specificity varies
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

For project 2

I have trained the model using 'imagenet weights' and have used VGG19 model

input size of image=(224,224,3)

I have selected only AP,PA,AP Supine views and only X-ray images dropping the CT scans

0-Covid-19,1-Other lung diseases

With validation got an accuracy of 87%

Without Validation got an accuracy of 85%

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For project 3:

Here I used a dataset from kaggle and the covid pics were taken from Cohen ieee github repo and normal images from Chest X-ray (pneumonia) dataset-actually it is a fusion of project 1 and 2

I have trained the model using 'imagenet weights' 

input size of image=(224,224,3)

epochs= 100
lr = 1e-4
BS = 16

I have used InceptionV3 model and got me an accuracy of 99%



IMPORTANT NOTE:
For projects 1 and 2 , I have used 3-fold validation and took the average accuracy to tell the results.

									   Thank you mam,

                                                                     For giving me this opportunity
